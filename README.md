# Apollo in Amplify Tutorial

This repo contains the result of following the instructions in the post [How to set up Apollo in Amplify](https://www.okgrow.com/posts/config-apollo-in-amplify). It is not intended to be a template for projects, but if you use this code, delete `team-provider-info.json` from .gitignore.

## Run

You'll need an AWS profile (run `amplify configure` if not).

Clone this repo, then from inside the project:

```
amplify init
amplify push
```
